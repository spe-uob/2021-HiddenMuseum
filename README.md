The goal of this project is to create an advanced search tool that interacts with the existing API given at (https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v1/#search-api-v1) in order to browse, filter and search a database of 2 million objects. This will also include images in the search results.

The plan for implementing this is to make a web application using a JavaScript framework and start by building a search tool that can use features of the objects to browse, filter and search them. We will also take into consideration accessibility for web tools. Then to expand on this we will implement something similar for images.
