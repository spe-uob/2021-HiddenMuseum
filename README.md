## Overview

Our goal is to produce a web app that allows for intuitive searching of datasets using the OpenData API.

This project is specifically done at the request of, and with the involvement of, the Bristol&nbsp;Museum & Arts&nbsp;Gallery.

**Hidden Museum** is developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework. The datasets we use are hosted by Bristol City Council, and are accessed with the OpenData API. The frontend is largely handled by Thymeleaf templates. *We are yet to decide on a CSS framework to use (and may not use one) depending on our needs.*
